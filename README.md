The most fun apple watch game ever! 

# Controls 

To move the player you use the digital crown. Scroll up and down to move to different positions 

# Gameplay 

Avoid the white dots and move for as long as you can

# Why?

I was learning watchOS 2 and decided to test out the communication struture between the phone and watch. Also I wanted to implement a different type of interaction on the what without having a finger cover the screen.
